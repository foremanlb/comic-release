      <p className='aboutParagraph'>My name is Craig Navarro and I am a software developer.  I created this site to assist the world of comic collectors.  Scrolling through all of the different news sites just to find what comics are being released and when can be a tiring act.  Bringing this information to one site will allow everyone to be able to keep track of their favorite comics easily.<br></br><br></br>I have been a fan of comics for sometime, and wanted to do something to assist the community that has given me so much joy.  I hope that you find this information useful and help to add to the site to make it more robust for all comics fans.</p>
