# Comic Release

## Project Description

Comic release will be a single website dedicated to release schedules of comic books. It is a frustrating thing to try and find the release dates for different comics as even the publishers website doesn't make it easy. There will also be a way for users to add comics to the schedule to make it easier for other collectors to find the less mainstream comic releases as well.

## SWOT Analysis

### Strengths:

I have a good understanding of what code I want to run to make my site work. I should be able to run through the physical code of the site fairly quickly.

### Weaknesses:

I am still prone to sloppy and wet code. I will need to set aside more time than I am accustomed to for refactoring to make sure my code is clean and DRY.

### Opportunities:

This will give me a much better understanding of the structure of API's and allow me to be able to dive deeper into the code that I can use to utilize it.

### Threats:

My biggest threat is getting into an obsessive nature with wanting specific CSS to work for me, spending too much time on it and limiting my media queries and refactoring ability.
